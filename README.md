# SOK Tech Radar ![Latest version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/s-group-dev/tech-radar)

[![Public Tech Radar](https://img.shields.io/badge/Public-TechRadar-26A0EE)](https://s-group-dev.github.io/tech-radar)

At [SOK](https://s-ryhma.fi/en), we maintain a [Tech Radar](https://s-group-dev.github.io/tech-radar) to help our engineering teams to align technology choices.

It is based on [Zalando Tech Radar](https://opensource.zalando.com/tech-radar/) ([source](https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar/tree/master/docs)) and [ThoughtWorks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). This repository contains the source code for our choises generated by using our internal tools ðŸ˜‰

## What is the purpose?

> [Weâ€™ve seen a rise](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) â€” particularly in the cloud space â€” of developer-facing tool integration, with the aggregation of tools for artifact repositories, source control, CI/CD pipelines, wikis, and others.

We're no exception. We want to consolidate our tool stacks to promise greater convience for developers to face less strain. Our Tech Radar gathers all technologies used and fasilitates discussion around them.

We do not - by any means - want to restrict our teams' technology choises but to encourage them to adopt the ones that are most native to us. This increases our maturity, helps to discover antipatterns and productises our approach. Our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development â€” changes that we think our engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their projects.
